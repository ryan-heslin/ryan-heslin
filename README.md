# My Profile

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you can find the various projects
I've developed or contributed to over the years.

I have a Masters in Data Science from American University.
I took an unconventional route there. Having studied history and political
science in college, I entered graduate school planning to become a policy analyst.
With that goal in mind, I taught myself R before classes started. Midway through
my first semester, I realized I enjoyed the R programming I was doing for an
assistantship more than my classes, so I made the leap to data science.

After I decided programming was my first love, I spent much of the intervening two years
writing code. After getting to grips with R, I
learned Python, picked up SQL and enough Bash to get by, and dabbled in Lua.
 I've become more proficient with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
the most popular Python data analysis library.

My GitHub activity gives a good overview of my interests. 

    * A few contributions to projects I liked (I should do more of this).
    * Some [R projects](https://github.com/ryan-heslin/RegLesson) that harness the language's data manipulation capabilities.
    * An [Advent of Code](https://github.com/ryan-heslin/AoC2022) repository, for practicing pure programming. 
    * Inevitably, my [personal dotfiles](https://github.com/ryan-heslin/dotfiles), an ever-growing set of configuration files centered on my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) setup.

I can also be found on LinkedIn at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-heslin/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-heslin/).
If you find anything I worked on even remotely useful, I'll be a happy man.
